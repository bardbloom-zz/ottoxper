Otto is probably not thread-safe, so I'll want one Otto instance per animal in

Let's have  SHREWs ruled by a Wombat

SHREW and TROUT are both Beast{} instances.
  DoAt(js string, t time.Time)
  
  Run()  // both of them do stuff autonomously (and record it)


BeastMaster{}, like Wombat
  BeastJustDid(js)
